  <actor name = "perf">
    A swish army knife of perf services.

    It can provide both ends of a fast echo for latency measurements
    and a sender or receiver of a fast flow for throughput measurements.

    Measurements are initiated via command messages with results
    returned.  While a measurement is ongoing the actor pipe is not
    serviced.  
  </actor>

  <class name="zperf">
    Synchronous API to perf actor.
  </class>

  <!-- This needed to get things into the build but will make
       .cpp/.hpp.  Will need manually run gsl on the *.xml files under
       src and overrite the .cpp/.hpp generated with the the .h/.c
       these generate.  Will also need to edit them to #include proper
       extensions.... -->
