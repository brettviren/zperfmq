  <actor name = "perf">
    A swish army knife of perf services.

    It can provide both ends of a fast echo for latency measurements
    and a sender or receiver of a fast flow for throughput measurements.

    Measurements are initiated via command messages with results
    returned.  While a measurement is ongoing the actor pipe is not
    serviced.
