The following ABNF grammar defines the The Zperf Protocol:

    hydra = hello socket *( measure | heartbeat ) [ goodbye ]
    hello   = C:HELLO   ( S:HELLO-OK   / S:INVALID / S:FAILED )
    socket  = C:SOCKET  ( S:SOCKET-OK  / S:INVALID / S:FAILED )
    measure = C:MEASURE ( S:RESULT     / S:INVALID / S:FAILED )
    heartbeat = C:PING S:PING-OK
    goodbye = C:GOODBYE ( S:GOODBYE-OK / S:INVALID / S:FAILED )
