  <!-- API methods.  Their names MUST match an event! -->

  <method name = "create perf" return = "status">
    Request a perf to be created with a given socket type.

    This is a synchronous call as the client will wait for
    confirmation.

    If successful, zperf_client_ident() can be used to retrieve the
    perf ident.  This ident is required for subsequent calls.

    <field name = "stype" type = "string">Socket type</field>

    <accept reply = "PERF IDENT" />

  </reply>

  <method name = "request borc" return = "status">
    Request that a measurement socket be attached to an endpoint.

    The attachment is either "bind" or "connect" (borc).  The ident
    comes from a create_perf() call.  A "connect" may be repeated on
    the same endpoint and a "bind" may have a wild card for the port.

    This is a synchronous call.

    The endpoint is available after a successful completion.
