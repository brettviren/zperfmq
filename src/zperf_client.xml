  <!-- API methods -->

  <method name = "create perf" return = "status">
    Request a perf to be created.  Returned perf ident is needed for
    any subsequent set_socket or set_measurement method calls .

  <method name = "set socket" return = "status">
    Request that a measurement socket be opened on the given endpoint
    where action is bind or connect.  The ident comes from a
    create_perf() call.
